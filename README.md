# TETH: Trapped ETH

Trap your ETH in this contract so it can never be recovered.

## Why ?

Trapping your ETH is the best way to give back to the Ethereum community. Sending funds to this contract is equivalent to burning them, which makes ETH more scarce, which makes it more valuable. When you trap ETH, evey ETH holder benefits proportionally to their holdings.

## Why not just send it to `address(0)` or to any other contract ?

If you send ETH to `address(0)` or to, say, the DAI contract, there will always be the question of whether you are a moron and did it by mistake. Sending your funds here makes it unquestionable that you did it for philantropic reasons.

## How will people know I am so awesome ?

Every wei you trap will be recorded in this contract. In the future I promise to make a UI with a leaderboard so you can show off your awesomeness.

## Can I trap DAI or other ERC-20 tokens ?

Of course ! This contract was designed in such a way, that anything you send here is irrécoverable.
